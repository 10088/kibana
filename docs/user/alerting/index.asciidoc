You can generate a report that contains a {kib} dashboard, visualization,
saved search, or Canvas workpad. Depending on the object type, you can export the data as
a PDF, PNG, or CSV document, which you can keep for yourself, or share with others.

Reporting is available from the *Share* menu
in *Discover*, *Visualize*, *Dashboard*, and *Canvas*.

== Setup

{reporting} is automatically enabled in {kib}. The first time {kib} runs, it extracts a custom build for the Chromium web browser, which
runs on the server in headless mode to load {kib} and capture the rendered {kib} charts as images.

Chromium is an open-source project not related to Elastic, but the Chromium binary for {kib} has been custom-built by Elastic to ensure it
works with minimal setup. However, the {kib} server OS might still require additional dependencies for Chromium. See the
<<reporting-troubleshooting-system-dependencies, Reporting troubleshooting>> section for more information about the system dependencies
for different operating systems.

== Roles and privileges

To generate a report, you must have the `reporting_user` role. You also need
the appropriate {kib} privileges to access the objects that you
want to report on and the {es} indices.  See <<secure-reporting, Reporting and security>>
for an example.

== Generate a report manually

. Open the dashboard, visualization, Canvas workpad, or saved search that you want to include in the report.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Share*.  If you are working in Canvas,
click the share icon image:user/reporting/images/canvas-share-button.png["Canvas Share button"].

. Select the option appropriate for your object. You can export:
+
** A dashboard or visualization as either a PNG or PDF document
** A Canvas workpad as a PDF document
** A saved search as a CSV document

. Generate the report.
+
A notification appears when the report is complete.

== Layout and sizing
The layout and size of the PDF or PNG image depends on the {kib} app
with which the Reporting plugin is integrated. For Canvas, the
worksheet dimensions determine the size for Reporting. In other apps,
the dimensions are taken on the fly by looking at
the size of the visualization elements or panels on the page.

The size dimensions are part of the reporting job parameters. Therefore, to
make the report output larger or smaller, you can change the size of the browser.
This resizes the shareable container before generating the
report, so the desired dimensions are passed in the job parameters.

In the following {kib} dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted.
The shareable container is captured when you click the
*Generate* or *Copy POST URL* button. It might take some trial and error
before you're satisfied with the layout and dimensions in the resulting
PNG or PDF image.
