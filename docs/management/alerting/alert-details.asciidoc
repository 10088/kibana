If you're working with time series data, you don't want to continually dump
everything into a single index. Instead, you might periodically roll over the
data to a new index to keep it from growing so big it's slow and expensive.
As the index ages and you query it less frequently, you’ll likely move it to
less expensive hardware and reduce the number of shards and replicas.

{kib}’s *Index Lifecycle Policies* walks you through the process for creating
and configuring a policy. Before using this feature, you should be familiar
with index lifecycle management:

* For an introduction, refer to
{ref}/getting-started-index-lifecycle-management.html[Getting started with index
lifecycle management].
* To dig into the concepts and technical details, see
{ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[Managing the index lifecycle].
* To check out the APIs, see {ref}/index-lifecycle-management-api.html[Index lifecycle management API].
